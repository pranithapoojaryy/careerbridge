## 1.5 Structure of the program
The ElevateHire platform follows a feature-based architecture with separate frontend and backend layers:

### 1.5.1 Frontend Architecture
Built with **Flutter**, the frontend uses:
- **Riverpod** for robust state management.
- **Feature-based structure** for scalability (Auth, College, Student, Resume, Aptitude, etc.).
- **Material Design 3** for a modern, responsive UI.

### 1.5.2 Module Description
1.  **Authentication & Identity Module**: Handles secure login, sign-up, email verification, and role-based routing.
2.  **College & Placement Module**: Allows admins to manage departments, batches, students, and publish events.
3.  **Student & Career Module**:
    *   **Profile Management**: Comprehensive profile with academic records, skills, and project information.
    *   **Resume Builder**: In-built, predefined templates with AI-assisted content suggestions.
    *   **Aptitude Center**: Access to practice quizzes with dynamically generated questions based on skill gaps.
    *   **Job Discovery**: Single interface for viewing and applying to college-posted and recruiter-posted opportunities.
    *   **Certificate Management**: Uploading and managing certifications with category-based validation status and skill point calculation.
    *   **AI Job Analyzer**: Advanced custom-built tools including "AI Resume Insights" for job matching and "Ask ElevateAI" career assistant.
        *   **Matching Engine**: A proprietary algorithmic engine that tokenizes resume text and job requirements to calculate a coverage-based score locally, without external AI APIs.
        *   **Self-Screening**: Real-time feedback for students allowing them to identify skill gaps against recruiter-posted requirements before applying.
        *   **Recruiter Integration**: Deeply integrated into the recruiter portal, allowing for automated candidate screening based on objective data.
4.  **Certification & Validation Engine**: A core module that validates external certifications (from 16+ providers), calculates skill points, and assigns trust scores.
5.  **Assessment & Practice Module**:
    *   **AI Question Generator**: Creates custom aptitude and technical questions.
    *   **Test Environment**: Secure interface for taking tests with timer libraries.
    *   **Scoring Engine**: auto-grades submissions and updates skill profiles.
6.  **Communication System**: Manages email templates, bulk sending capabilities via Resend, and notification logs.
7.  **Recruiter & Job Insights Module**: Features for job posting, candidate search (filtering by skill/score), and application tracking.
8.  **AI-Powered Job Matching & Insights System**:
    *   **Core Engine**: A `ResumeMatchingService` performing real-time PDF text extraction and custom keyword tokenization (strictly internal).
    *   **Intelligent Scoring**: Weighted algorithmic matching prioritizing recruiter requirements with fallback to job description context.
    *   **Actionable Insights**: High-visibility UI feedback via a Match Chip and Skills Breakdown dialog (Matched vs. Missing Keywords).
