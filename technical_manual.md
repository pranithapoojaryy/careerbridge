# ElevateHire: Full Technical Manual

This manual provides a detailed architectural and functional breakdown of the **ElevateHire** application. It is designed for technical stakeholders, developers, and administrators who need to understand the platform's core systems.

## 🏗️ 1. Architecture Overview: Flutter & Dart

ElevateHire is built on a modern, reactive stack designed for high performance and scalability across Web and Mobile.

### What is Flutter?
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It allows for a single codebase that compiles to **native machine code** for high-end performance.
- **Rendering Engine**: Flutter doesn't use web views; it has its own rendering engine (Skia/Impeller) to draw buttons and layouts directly at 60+ FPS.
- **AOT Compilation**: The application is compiled "Ahead-of-Time," meaning it's extremely fast to start and execute.

### The Role of Dart
Dart is the underlying language for Flutter. It is optimized for building user interfaces and features **sound type safety**, ensuring that data flows through the app without hidden errors.

## 🔐 2. Identity & Security: Supabase Auth & JWT

Security is enforced at two levels: the application (UI) and the database (API).

### Supabase Auth (GoTrue)
The platform uses Supabase's authentication service. When a user logs in, Supabase issues a **JSON Web Token (JWT)**.
- **The "AuthWrapper"**: Located at the root of the app, this component listens to a stream called `onAuthStateChange`. If a user is logged in, it shows the dashboard; otherwise, it presents the login screen.

### Understanding JWT (The "Secure Pass Card")
Every time the app talks to the database, it sends a **JWT** in the header.
1.  **Header**: Defines the algorithm (e.g., HS256).
2.  **Payload (The Claims)**: Contains the user's `id`, `email`, and `role`. Supabase uses this to know who is making the request.
3.  **Signature**: Ensures that the token hasn't been tampered with.

### Row Level Security (RLS)
The database (PostgreSQL) uses **RLS policies**. For example:
- **Student Policy**: `auth.uid() = id`. This ensures a student can *only* see their own profile and uploaded certificates.
- **College Policy**: Allows admins to view all certificates uploaded by students belonging to their specific organization.

## 🧠 3. ElevateAI: The Hybrid Intelligence Model

ElevateAI serves as a conversational bridge between the user and the platform's features.

### Hybrid Strategy
- **Local Rules**: For simple commands like "Go to my profile," the app uses local pattern-matching. This is instantaneous and works without any API cost.
- **Think Mode (Gemini 2.0 Flash)**: When deep career coaching or strategic advice is needed, the app switches to an LLM via **OpenRouter**. It uses the `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001` model for its high reasoning capabilities.

### Navigation Atlas
The AI contains an internal "Map" of the application. When it identifies a user intent, it returns a special command like `[NAVIGATE: /student-dashboard?index=5]`, which the Flutter app executes to take the user to the right section.

## 📜 4. Certification System & Verification

One of the platform's core features is the **Trust-based Certification Pipeline**.

### The Flow:
1.  **Upload**: Student uploads a PDF/Image.
2.  **Extraction**: AI extracts the issuer, logo, and skills.
3.  **Verification**: 
    - **External**: API checks with providers like NPTEL or Google.
    - **Manual**: College admins review and Approve/Reject.

### Rejection Transparency
If a certificate is rejected, the admin provides a **Rejection Reason** (stored in the `rejection_reason` column). This is immediately displayed on the student's dashboard in a high-contrast red alert box.

### Public QR Verification
The route `/verify?id=[CERT_ID]` is **publicly accessible**. It uses a premium **Claymorphic (3D)** design theme to wowed recruiters. It provides live, server-side validation results without requiring the recruiter to have an account.

## 💼 5. Recruitment & Job Pipeline

Recruiters use a specialized dashboard to manage the end-to-end hiring cycle.

### Job Posting States
Jobs move through a strict lifecycle: `draft` -> `open` -> `closed`.
Recruiters can define precise "Skill Requirements" which the AI uses to rank applicants.

### Hiring Pipeline States
Applications for jobs follow a state machine:
- `applied` (Standard entry)
- `shortlisted` (Admin approved)
- `interview` (Scheduled)
- `hired` (Final success)

---

## 🚀 6. Infrastructure & Deployment

### Vercel Deployment
The web version is hosted on Vercel. We use a custom build process:
```bash
flutter build web --release --no-tree-shake-icons
```
This ensures all 3D icons and modern typography are bundled correctly for the production web environment.

### Supabase BaaS
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Relational data).
- **Storage**: Used for hosting student CVs and certificate proofs.
- **Real-time**: Used for instant notifications (e.g., when a student is hired or a certificate is approved).

## 📡 7. Deep-Dive: Supabase Querying & Communication

This section explains how the Flutter application communicates with the Supabase backend and the exact syntax used for data retrieval.

### The Singleton Pattern
The application initializes the Supabase client once in `main.dart`:
```dart
await Supabase.initialize(url: 'https://...', anonKey: '...');
```
Once initialized, any part of the app can access the client via `Supabase.instance.client`. This singleton ensures that we maintain a single connection pool and shared authentication state.

### How Querying Works (PostgREST)
Supabase uses **PostgREST**, which automatically turns your Database Schema into a RESTful API. When you write Flutter code, the SDK translates it into a standard HTTP request.

#### Basic Query Example:
```dart
final response = await Supabase.instance.client
    .from('profiles')       // 1. Target the table
    .select()               // 2. Specify columns (empty = all)
    .eq('id', userId)      // 3. Add a filter (Where id = userId)
    .single();              // 4. Expect exactly one record
```

#### Complex Query Example (from `college_repository.dart`):
For advanced filtering, such as the "Approved" tab in the college dashboard, we use a more dynamic approach:
```dart
var query = _supabase
    .from('view_college_all_certifications')
    .select()
    .eq('college_id', collegeId);

// Conditional filtering
if (status == 'approved') {
    // Uses the 'in' operator to match any of the successful status strings
    query = query.filter('validation_status', 'in', ['verified', 'approved', 'college_verified']);
}

final response = await query; // Execution happens here
```

### The Communication Pipeline
1.  **Request Construction**: The Flutter SDK builds a URL (e.g., `.../rest/v1/profiles?id=eq.123`).
2.  **Auth Injection**: The SDK automatically fetches the current **JWT (Access Token)** from memory and injects it into the `Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>` header.
3.  **Server-Side RLS**: Supabase receives the request, identifies the user from the JWT, and runs the **Row Level Security** policies against the query.
4.  **JSON Response**: The database returns the filtered results as a JSON map, which the app then converts into Dart objects (Models).

### Real-time Communication
For features like notifications or live dashboard updates, the app uses **WebSockets**:
```dart
final subscription = Supabase.instance.client
    .channel('public:notifications')
    .on(RealtimeListenTypes.postgresChanges, 
        ChannelFilter(event: 'INSERT', table: 'notifications'), 
        (payload, [ref]) {
          // Handle live update
        })
    .subscribe();
```
This avoids constant "polling" and ensures the UI is always in sync with the database.
