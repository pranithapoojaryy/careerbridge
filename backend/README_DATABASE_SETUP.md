# ElevateHire Database Setup Guide

## 🚀 Quick Setup (Recommended)

### Option 1: Complete Setup (One Command)
Run this single file in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the entire content of setup_database_complete.sql
-- This will create all tables, indexes, policies, and initial data
```

**File to run:** `setup_database_complete.sql`

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to run migrations step by step:

### Step 1: Base Tables
```sql
-- Run: migration_001_base_tables.sql
-- Creates: organizations, profiles, college structure
```

### Step 2: Student System
```sql
-- Run: migration_002_student_system.sql  
-- Creates: student profiles, academic records, projects, achievements
```

### Step 3: Events & Assessments
```sql
-- Run: migration_003_events_assessments.sql
-- Creates: skills, events, assessments, questions, attempts
```

### Step 4: Communication & Analytics
```sql
-- Run: migration_004_communication_analytics.sql
-- Creates: announcements, messages, mock interviews, learning paths, analytics
```

## 🔐 Security Features

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Enabled on all tables** for data protection
- **Role-based access control** (Student, College Admin, Recruiter)
- **Organization-level isolation** (colleges can only see their data)

### Key Policies
- Students can only access their own data
- College admins can manage their college's data
- Cross-organization data is protected
- Public data (skills, published events) is accessible to all

---

## 📊 Pre-loaded Data

### Skills Catalog (25+ skills)
- **Programming:** Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, TypeScript

- **Soft Skills:** Communication, Leadership, Problem Solving, Teamwork

---

## 🔧 Performance Optimizations

### Indexes Created
- **Search optimization** on names, emails, skills
- **Filter optimization** on departments, batches, status
- **Date range queries** for events and analytics
- **Foreign key relationships** for joins

### Triggers
- **Auto-update timestamps** on record changes
- **Profile completion calculation** 
- **Activity logging** for analytics

---

## 🧪 Testing the Setup

### 1. Verify Tables Created
```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name LIKE '%student%' OR table_name LIKE '%event%' OR table_name LIKE '%assessment%'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

### 2. Check Skills Data
```sql
SELECT name, category, subcategory 
FROM public.skills 
ORDER BY category, name;
```

### 3. Verify RLS Policies
```sql
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Column does not exist" Error
**Solution:** Run the complete setup file instead of individual migrations, or ensure you run migrations in order.

#### 2. "Permission denied" Error  
**Solution:** Make sure you're running the SQL as a database admin in Supabase.

#### 3. "Relation already exists" Error
**Solution:** This is normal - the script uses `IF NOT EXISTS` to handle existing tables safely.

#### 4. Foreign Key Constraint Error
**Solution:** Ensure base tables (organizations, profiles) exist before running dependent migrations.

### Verification Commands

```sql
-- Check if all main tables exist
SELECT COUNT(*) as table_count 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name IN (
    'profiles', 'organizations', 'student_profiles', 
    'events', 'assessments', 'skills', 'messages'
);
-- Should return 7

-- Check skills data loaded
SELECT COUNT(*) as skills_count FROM public.skills;
-- Should return 25+

-- Check RLS enabled
SELECT COUNT(*) as rls_enabled_tables
FROM information_schema.tables t
JOIN pg_class c ON c.relname = t.table_name
WHERE t.table_schema = 'public' 
AND c.relrowsecurity = true;
-- Should return 20+
```

2. **Create Sample Data** - Add test events, assessments, and students
3. **Configure Authentication** - Ensure user roles are properly set
4. **Test Features** - Create events, assessments, manage students
