# Role-Based Authentication System

## Overview
Restored and enhanced the role-based authentication system for ElevateHire with separate registration flows for Students, Colleges, and Recruiters.

## Authentication Flow

### 1. Login Screen (`/login`)
- **Role Selection UI**: Visual toggle between Student, Recruiter, and College
- **Single Login Form**: Works for all user types
- **Role-Based Routing**: Automatically routes users to appropriate dashboard after login
- **Sign Up Link**: Redirects to role selection screen

### 2. Role Selection Screen (`/role-selection`)
- **Three Role Options**:
  - **Student**: Find jobs, build resume, track applications
  - **College/University**: Manage placements, coordinate with recruiters
  - **Recruiter/HR**: Post jobs, discover talent, manage hiring
- **Feature Preview**: Shows key features for each role
- **Visual Design**: Color-coded cards with icons and descriptions

### 3. Registration Screens

#### Student Registration (`/student-register`)
- Multi-step registration process
- College selection and email domain matching
- Profile setup with academic details
- Resume upload capability

#### College Registration (`/college-register`)
- Organization setup (name, type, location)
- Admin account creation
- Department and program configuration
- Verification process

#### Recruiter Registration (`/recruiter-register`)
- **Step 1**: Personal information (name, email, password)
- **Step 2**: Company information (name, size, industry, location)
- Company size options (1-10, 11-50, 51-200, etc.)
- Industry selection (Technology, Finance, Healthcare, etc.)

## User Roles and Routing

### Supported Roles:
- `student` → Student Dashboard
- `college`, `college_admin`, `admin` → College Dashboard  
- `recruiter`, `HR` → Recruiter Dashboard (placeholder)

### Role-Based Dashboard Routing:
```dart
switch (role) {
  case 'student':
    return StudentDashboardScreen();
  case 'college':
  case 'college_admin': 
  case 'admin':
    return CollegeDashboardScreen();
  case 'recruiter':
  case 'HR':
    return RecruiterDashboard(); // Coming soon
}
```

## Routes Configuration

```dart
routes: {
  '/': AuthWrapper(),
  '/login': LoginScreen(),
  '/role-selection': RoleSelectionScreen(),
  '/student-register': StudentRegistrationScreen(),
  '/college-register': CollegeRegistrationScreen(),
  '/recruiter-register': RecruiterRegistrationScreen(),
  '/dashboard': AppWrapper(),
  // ... other routes
}
```

## Database Schema
